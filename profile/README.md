# Aphre
Aphre is an non-profit orginization made by @d1novnc to give you information about the web. (Kinda like Wikipedia) I specialize in html and css.

## My Site
This site is in progress: https://myresourcecenter.netlify.app

## MyResourceCenter
MyResourceCenter is a one of the projects owned by Aphre. MyResourceCenter specializes in giving you topics, ideas, information about the web, and bugs and how to fix them! Currently,
this is the only site owned by Aphre.

## Copyright
If Aphre has made a site that you or any other orginization has owned, don't hesitate to email me so that I can fix the problem and no one will get in trouble.
My email is: d1zoom@outlook.com (Some days, I might not answer your email so please be patient. Thanks!)
